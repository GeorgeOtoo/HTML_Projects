    <h1>Our Story</h1>
      <ul style="list-style-type:square">
        <li><p>
          In 1999, Rab's Tavern was founded by the Blemah's family. Unpon purchasing their first building in the
          city of New York, the Blemah's envisioned memories that will be made by their customers.
          As a result, the walls in the restaurant are decorated with memories captured from our value customers.
        </p></li>
        <li><p>
          Our goal is to provide our customers with an experience that
          they will cherish for a lifetime. Since our opening in 1999, we have created an environment
          where people come to relax and alleviate the the stress and tiredness faced during the day.
          Our employees treat our customers with the outmost care and hospitability. We are still striving
          in making our tavern a home away from your home.
